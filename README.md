# tumblr-image-downloader
This is a simple image downloader that works in tumblr blogs.
This is developped with a simple python script.
It just require Python 3 (I don't try with python 2) and the beautifulsoup 4 librairy (hard to install on windows :( )

You just select a folder to export downloaded images and paste a tumblr BLOG url.
And let operate the magic !!

The program save images chronologically (1.jpg,2.png,3.png,4.gif,5.fu***ngImageExtension...).
I used it to download manga scans and translate it easily.
It is very useful for this work or for download a manga !
